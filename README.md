This is my vim configuration hosted on GitHub. It is used to maintain consistent vim configuration on different machines, majorly Linux and Mac OS X.

#### How it is organized

- All plug-ins are managed by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
- `vimrc` is composed of combining all `.vim` files in `rc/`.
