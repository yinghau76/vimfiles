This is my vim configuration hosted on GitHub. I use it to maintain consistent vim configuration on different machines, majorly Linux and Mac OS X.

#### How it is organized

It was originally organized with [Patheogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and migrated to [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).
